### Building abstractions with data
* chapter 1
	* computational processes
	* role of procedures in program design
	* primitive data & operations (numbers and arithmetic)
	* how form compound procedures
		* composition, conditionals, parameters, functional abstraction
	* procedure
		* pattern for the local evolution of a process
		* classification, reasoning, analysis
	* higher-order procedures
		* enables manipulating and reasoning in terms of general methods of computation
* chapter 2
	* more complex data
		* simple data not sufficent for many purposes
		* programs typically model complex phenomena
			* often one must construct computational objects with several parts to model real-world phenomena
	* another key aspect of programming:
		* building abstractions by combining data objects
		* compound data
* why compound data?
	* elevate the conceptual level at which we can design our programs
	* increase modularity of designs
	* enhance expressive power 
* e.g. storing numerator and denominator of a rational number together instead of as seperate variables
	* seperate numerators and denominators would lead to a very cluttered program
 * modularity
	 * if we can manipulate rationals as objects in their own right, can seperate details of how to manipulate them from where the manipulations are actually used
	* data abstraction
		* isolating parts of a program that deal with how data is represented/manipulated from parts that use that type of data
* allows writing generic procedures that can perform similar operations on any data type passed in that is supported by the generic procedure
