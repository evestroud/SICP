(basic cons list stuff)

### Closure Property
* an operation for combining data objects satisfies the closure property if the results of combining things with that operation can themselves be combined using the same operation
	* basically - recursive data structures
* authors are very weird about function closures having the same name, but clearly lost that battle 
	* text seems to be so old that arraylists haven't been invented yet
	* I feel like even C arrays could be made recursive by pointing to each other???
	* big weird 'nerd angry about nothing' vibes

##### Exercise 2.19
The order of the list coin-values does affect the answer produces, because getting the correct answer relies on processing the coins from largest denomination to smallest.

#### Mapping over lists
* map has two uses:
	* applying a single-argument function over every element in a list, return a list of the results of each application
	* applying an n-argument function across n lists, taking the ith item in each list for each of the n arguments, returning a list of the results of applying the function to every ith item of the lists
 
```
(map + 
     (list 1 2 3) 
     (list 40 50 60) 
     (list 700 800 900))
(741 852 963)

(map (lambda (x y) (+ x (* 2 y)))
     (list 1 2 3)
     (list 4 5 6))
(9 12 15)
```

##### Exercise 2.22
* part 1:
	* in either iteration or recursion, the desired function is applied at each step
	* since cons can only append to the front of the list, and in iteration the base case of the result is passed in from the top, an iterative function using cons as an operation can only possibly build a list up backwards
		* in the first step, the first result is added to the base case (empty list)
		* in the second step, the second result is consed to the front of the list, putting it before the first result
		* etc.
* part 2
	* it does work, but produces an uh non-standard data structure
	* the output is a list of lists, each layer of which is consed to the output of the desired function
	* by reversing the use of car and cdr, this list could function exactly the same as a standard list
		* gonna call this a "tall" list

##### Exercise 2.24
(1 (2 (3 4)
   |     \
 1   (2 (3 4))
          |    \
	    2    (3 4)
	            |    \
			   3   4

##### Exercise 2.25
`(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr '(1 3 (5 7) 9))))))
`(car (car '((7))))
`(cadr (cadr (cadr (cadr (cadr (cadr '(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))))))))

##### Exercise 2.26
`(1 2 3 4 5 6)
`(1 2 3 (4 5 6))
`((1 2 3) (4 5 6))

##### Exercise 2.32
`subsets` takes the first element in `s` and adds it to beginning of all the subsets of the `cdr` of `s`. In recursively producing the subsets, `nil` is always reached to which a single element is always added, various permutations of the subsets can then be added onto it, and `nil` will always be the last item added to the output (first item in the list)


### 2.2.3 Sequences as Conventional Interfaces
* conventional interfaces
    * working with compound data can be broken down in a process similar to analog signal processing
    * can conceptualize as a cascade of stages each implementing part of the program
    * organizing programs to have a signal-flow structure increases conceptual clarity of code

### Sequence Operations
* key to organizing programs in this way is to focus on "signals"
    * value of expressing programs as sequence operations:
        * helps design programs that are modular (constructed by combining relatively independent pieces
    * can encourage modular design by providing a library of standard components with a conventional interface
* modular construction
    * powerful strategy for controlling complexity
    * in electronics signal processing, systems are often made of cascading elements of standardized filters and transducers
    * sequence operations can provide a library of 'mix and match' program elements
* sequences as conventional interfaces
    * permits combining data processing modules
    * localize the data structure dependencies to a small number of operations (map, filter, reduce, forEach)
    * allows experimenting with alternative representations while leaving overall design intact

##### Exercise 2.38
`(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
* 3/1 -> 2/3 -> 1/(2/3) = 3/2
`(fold-left  / 1 (list 1 2 3))
* 1 / 1 -> 1 / 2 -> (1/2)/3 = 1/6
`(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
* (3 ()) -> (2 (3 ())) -> (1 (2 (3 ())))
`(fold-left  list nil (list 1 2 3))
* (() 1) -> ((() 1) 2) -> (((() 1) 2) 3)

Fold-left and fold-right will produce the same result only if they satisfy the commutative property


### Nested Mappings
* can extend this paradigm to include computations that are commonly expressed using nested loops
* flatmap
    * mapping, then accumulating with append
    * nested maps can create unnecessary lists around the final mapped values, accumulating with append "flattens" this

### Levels of language for robust design
* stratified design
    * idea that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels
    * each level described with a sequence of "languages"
        * "languages" as in the specific APIs for each level of abstraction
        * each level is constructed by combining parts from the lower level ("primitive" parts)
        * at each level, the "language" used has primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction appropriate to the level
* stratified design pervades the engineering of complex systems
    * computer engineering
        * resistors and transistors are combined to produce logic gates
        * logic gates are combined to produce digital circuits
        * digital circuits combined to produces processors and other computer systems
        * -> whole computers -> distributed systems
* stratified design helps make programs robust
    * small changes to the specification only requires small changes to the program
