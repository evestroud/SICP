* previous section:
    * how to design systems in which data objects can be represented in more than one way
    * key idea: 
        * link the code that specifies the data operations to the representations by way of generic interface procedures
* this section:
    * how to use this idea to also define operations that are generic over different kinds of arguments
    * have seen several different packages of arithmetic operations on different kinds of numbers:
        * primitive: `+-*/
        * rationals: `add-rat sub-rad mul-rat div-rat
        * complex: `add-complex sub-complex mul-complex div-complex
    * will now use data-directed techniques to construct a package that incorporates all the arithmetic packages we have seen so far
* structure of the system to be built:
    * Figure 2.23
    * single procedure `add` that operates on any number supplied
        * `add` is part of a generic interface that allows the separate arithmetic packages to be accessed with one entry point
    * any individual arithmetic packages (e.g. complex number package) may itself be accessed through its own generic procedures that combine packages for different representations (2.4)
    * structure is additive: 
        * individual arithmetic packages can be designed separately and combined

### 2.5.1 Generic Arithmetic Operations
* task of designing generic arithmetic operations 
    * analogous to that of designing the generic complex number operations
    * would like (for example) to have a generic addition procedure `add
        * acts like `+` on integers
        * acts like `add-rat` on rationals
        * acts like `add-complex` on complex numbers
    * can implement `add` by following the same strategy as 2.4.3
        * attach a type tag to each type of number
        * use type dispatch to call the appropriate package inside the generic procedure
* begin by installing a package for handling primitive numbers
    * tagged with `scheme-number
    * arithmetic operations in this package are primitive arithmetic procedures `+-*/
    * inserted into operation/type table using the operation name and parameter signature
    * external constructor created by `get`ting the procedure from the table
* using this framework, can easily add rational numbers
* complex numbers
    * can install the rectangular and polar packages from 2.4.3 as a single package by tagging either format with `'complex`
        * then internally using the generic complex number procedures to operate on the internal data type
    * programs from outside the complex number package can construct complex numbers from either real and imaginary parts or magnitude and angle
        * constructors are first exported from the rectangular and polar packages, then re-exported by the complex package
    * two-level tag system
        * outer tag (`'complex`) is used to direct the number to the complex number package
        * inner tack (`'rectangular` or `'polar`) is then used to direct the number to the appropriate implementation
    * a large and complicated system may have many levels of abstraction each with systems of generic operations
        * as a data object descends from higher levels of abstraction, outer tags are stripped off and more concrete procedures are accessed until raw data can be operated directly on

Exercise 2.77
* This works by re-exporting the internal generic selectors from the complex package to the outer level of the program
* a call for `magnitude` from the outer level of the program accesses the generic selector from the complex package and removes the type tag
    * the generic selector from the complex package chooses the appropriate implementation by checking the type tag and passing in the raw data
        * the implementation from the rectangular or polar package performs the final operations to return the correct value

### 2.5.2 Combining Data of Different Types
* so far:
    * unified arithmetic system 
        * encompasses integers, rationals, and complex numbers
        * additive model means other number types can be added
    * important issue with this system:
        * operations defined so far treat different data types as being completely independent (and incompatible)
        * it is meaningful to be able to operating on mixed types of numbers so need a way to implement this
* introducing cross-type operations 
    * in a controlled way:
        * important to maintain abstraction barriers already present
    * one way to handle cross-type operations:
        * design a different procedure for each valid combination of types
        * works, but is cumbersome
            * cost of introducing a new type is not just the construction of the package for the type
            * but also construction and installation of cross-type procedures
            * undermines ability to combine packages additively
            * formulating policies on the division of responsibility among packages can be overwhelming in systems with many packages and types

##### Coercion
* in the situation of completely unrelated types:
    * explicit cross-type operations is the best one can hope for
* however, can usually take advantage of structure of existing type system
    * often different data types are not completely independent
    * may be a way that objects of one type can be viewed as being of another type
        * *coercion*
        * e.g. an integer can be viewed as a complex number with an imaginary part of zero
        * transform problem of combining two different types to combining two objects of the same type
* can implement this idea by designing coercion procedures that transform an object of one type to an equivalent object of a different type
    * install these procedures in a special coercion table mapped by the two types
        * table may not be exhaustive, not all types can be coerced
    * modify `apply-generic` to search this table if an operation with a signature that accepts the incoming types isn't found in the main operations table
        * if a coercion is found, recursively call `apply-generic` with the coerced types
    * many advantages over defining explicit cross-type operations
        * still need to write coercion procedures (possibly n^2 procedures for n types)
            * but only need to write one procedure for each pair (since the table searches both directions of coercion)
            * also possible to design a more sophisticated system with multi-step coercions to reduce the total number of functions that need to be written
        * may be applications for which this scheme is not general enough
            * even if a coercion between two types is not possible, may be possible to coerce both into a third type
            * in order to deal with this complexity and still preserve modularity, it is usually necessary to build systems that take advantage of further structure in relations among types

##### Hierarchies of types
* This coercion scheme relies on the natural relations between the pairs of types
* Often there is a more 'global' structure in how different types relate to each other
    * e.g. generic arithmetic system to handle integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers
        * can regard an integer as a special kind of rational, which is in turn a special kind of real, which is in turn a special kind of complex number
* "hierarchy of types"
    * integers are a subtype of rational numbers
        * any operation that can be applied to a rational number can automatically be applied to any integer
        * conversely, rational numbers are a supertype of integers
    * this is a very simple example of a type hierarchy
        * "tower"
            * complex <- real <- rational <- integer 
                * (diagram is vertical in text)
* tower structure
    * can greatly simplify the problem of adding a new type
        * only need to specify how the new type is embedded in the next supertype above it and how it is the supertype of the type below it
    * e.g. if we want to add an integer and a complex number
        * don't need to explicitly define a specific coercion function
            * instead define coercions between super- and sub- types and allow the system to perform complex coercions by converting through the levels of the types
        * transform the integer -> rational -> real -> complex then add it to the complex number
* can redesign `apply-generic` in the following way: 
    * for each type, need a procedure `raise` 
        * `raise` - converts the type into its supertype
        * when the system is required to operate on objects of different types it can successively raise the lower types until all the objects are the same level in the tower
* another advantage of the tower structure:
    * can easily implement the notion that every type "inherits" all operations defined on a supertype
    * if we do not define a special procedure for finding the real part of an integer, we should still expect that `real-part` will be defined for all integers
        * since they are a sub-type of complex numbers
    * can implement this as a part of `apply-generic`
        * if the required operation is not directly defined for the type of the object given, we can raise the object to its supertype and try again
        * 'crawl up the tower' - transforming the argument until either a level at which the desired operation can be performed or reach the top of the tower and give up
* yet another advantage of a tower over a more general hierarchy:
    * gives us a simple way to 'lower' a data object to the simplest representation
    * e.g. if adding two complex numbers where the imaginary parts cancel out, it is possible to automatically detect that it should be converted to a lower data type on the tower
    * the trick to to have a general way to distinguish which objects can be lowered from those which cannot
        * in this case, whether `(=0? (imag-part n))`

##### Inadequacies of Hierarchies
* If our data types can be naturally arranged into a tower, problem of dealing with generic operations on different types can be greatly simplified
    * unfortunately, this is not usually the case
* e.g. the hierarchy of categories of two-dimensional shapes
    * each type may have more than one sub-type
        * e.g. 'polygon' has subtypes of 'triangle', 'quadrilateral', etc.
    * a type may also have more than one supertype
        * e.g. an 'isosceles right triangle' is a subtype of both 'isosceles' and 'right' triangles
* not having a unique supertype in particular is difficult because a decision has to be made about which supertype to raise to
    * may involve searching through a complex type network
* there is a similar problem for coercing a value 'down' to a lower type since there are commonly multiple subtypes
    * dealing with large numbers of interrelated types while still preserving modularity of design in large systems is very difficult

Exercise 2.81
1. `apply-generic` recurses infinitely, searching for a version of `exp` that takes a complex, not finding it, then searching for a coercion and always finding a `complex->complex`
2. I do not understand the concern about same-type coercions. I cannot think of a situation where this might even occur in the current system. 
3. (did this in my `get-coercion` function)

Exercise 2.82
* This approach will not work with operations that expect different types to be passed in. An example might be a version of `exp` that can handle a complex number as its base and an int or rational as the exponent. This version of `apply-generic` will not even try mixing types to pass to an operation, instead it will always try to coerce all arguments to the same type

Exercise 2.86
* the various primitive functions from the `complex` package will need to be re-written to be generic
    * constructors
        * type guard for constructing with another `complex`?
            * possibly safe to just use add-complex for the two args?
            * in what scenarios might ^ occur? possibly okay to just ignore or prevent
            * initial approach - throw
    * any operation which performs primitive operations on the `real` and `imag` parts must be generic (might be called on a `rational`)
        * mostly already implemented
        * will need `sine` and `cosine` generics & implementations in `rational`
        * possibly others?
