* previous section:
    * how to design systems in which data objects can be represented in more than one way
    * key idea: 
        * link the code that specifies the data operations to the representations by way of generic interface procedures
* this section:
    * how to use this idea to also define operations that are generic over different kinds of arguments
    * have seen several different packages of arithmetic operations on different kinds of numbers:
        * primitive: `+-*/
        * rationals: `add-rat sub-rad mul-rat div-rat
        * complex: `add-complex sub-complex mul-complex div-complex
    * will now use data-directed techniques to construct a package that incorporates all the arithmetic packages we have seen so far
* structure of the system to be built:
    * Figure 2.23
    * single procedure `add` that operates on any number supplied
        * `add` is part of a generic interface that allows the separate arithmetic packages to be accessed with one entry point
    * any individual arithmetic packages (e.g. complex number package) may itself be accessed through its own generic procedures that combine packages for different representations (2.4)
    * structure is additive: 
        * individual arithmetic packages can be designed separately and combined
