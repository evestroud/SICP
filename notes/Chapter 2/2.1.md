Chapter 1 - functional abstraction
Chapter 2 - data abstraction

* data abstraction
	* enables isolating details of how a compound data object is used from details of how it is implemented
	* basic idea: structure programs that use compound data so they operate on "abstract data"
		* make no unnecessary assumptions about data 
		* concrete representation is defined independently
	* interface: selectors and constructors

### 2.1.1
* rational numbers
	* numerator / denominator
	* interface
		* (make-rat n d) - constructor, returns a rational
		* (numer rat) - selector, returns the numerator
		* (denom rat) - selector, returns the denominator
	* arithmetic functions `+-*/` 
		* use accessors to get num/denom and perform basic fraction manipulation
		* use constructor to return a new rational after new num/denom are established
* pairs
	* basic data structure of lisps
		* cons/car/cdr
* representing rational numbers
	* pairs can be used to connect a numerator and denominator into a single data structure
	* (define (make-rat n d) (cons n d)) produces a pair with the supplied numerator in the car position and the supplied denominator in the cdr position
		* numer and denom can be implemented by using car & cdr
	* reducing rationals can be implemented using `gcd` from 1.2.5

### 2.1.2 Abstraction Barriers
* underlying idea of data abstraction:
	* identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed
	* only use those operations in manipulating the data
* abstraction barriers
	* seperate parts of the program that use the data abstraction from the parts that implement the abstraction
	* makes programs easier to maintain and modify
	* constraining dependence on representation to interface procedures helps design and modify programs

### 2.1.3 What Is Meant by Data?
* data
	* collection of selectors and constructors, together with conditions that must be met in order to be a valid representation
* e.g. pairs
	* cons, car, cdr
	* satisfy the condition that:
		* given x and y, if z = (cons x y) then x = (car z) and y = (cdr z)


##### Exercise 2.4
* cons takes two arguments and returns a function that takes one argument and calls it on the original arguments to cons
* car takes one argument, and attempts to call it with another function that takes two args and returns the first 
	* if the argument passed to z is a cons, calling z will immediately call the function passed in to it
	* calling the function defined in car inside the original cons closure will pass the values the cons closure was called with and return the first
* to implement cdr, copy cons but inside the lambda return the second argument instead of the first
	* `(define (cdr z)
	* `  (z (lambda (p q) q)))

##### Exercise 2.5
* positive exponents of 2 will always be even, and positive exponents of 3 will always be odd
	* therefore, a and b can be calculated from any number of the format `c = 2^a * 3^b` by factoring out all factors of 2 and 3
	* an inefficient yet effective approach would be to repeatedly divide c by 2 (counting how many factors of 2 there are) until an odd number is found, then repeating for 3 until a value of 1 is found

##### Exercise 2.6
`(add-1 zero)
`(add-1 (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x))
`(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) x) f) x)))))
`(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((lambda (x) x) x)))
`(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x)) <- one

`(add-1 one)
`(add-1 (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))))
`(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))) x)))))
`(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f x)))) <- two

##### Exercise 2.9
addition (subtraction just change the +s to -s):
`((ux + uy) - (lx + ly)) / 2
`==
`((ux - lx) / 2) + ((uy - ly) / 2)

```
(width-interval (mul-interval (make-interval 1 2) (make-interval 0 3)))
> -3
(* (width-interval (make-interval 1 2)) (width-interval (make-interval 0 3)))
> 3/4
```
