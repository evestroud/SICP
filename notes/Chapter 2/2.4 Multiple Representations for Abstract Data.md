data abstraction
* methodology for structuring systems
    * much of a program can be specified independent of the choices involved in implementing the data objects
    * example 2.1.1
        * how to separate the task of designing a program that uses rational numbers from the task of implementing rational numbers in computer primitives
        * key idea: erect an abstraction barrier
            * selectors and constructors for rational numbers
            * isolates the way rational numbers are used from their underlying representation
            * similar barrier isolates details of procedures that perform rational arithmetic from higher-level procedures that use rational numbers
* data abstraction barriers
    * powerful tools for controlling complexity
        * by isolating the underlying representations of data objects, we can divide the task of designing a large program into smaller tasks
    * however, may not make sense to speak of "the underlying representation" of a data object
        * might be more than one useful representation
        * might like to design systems that can handle multiple representations
    * example: complex numbers
        * may be represented in two almost equivalent ways
            * rectangular form (real + imaginary parts)
            * polar form (magnitude and angle)
        * which is more appropriate depends on use
            * reasonable to consider a system where procedures can work with either representation
* programs are often designed by many people working over extended periods of time
    * subject to requirements that change over time
    * not possible for everyone to agree in advance on data representation
    * in addition to data abstraction barriers that isolate representation from use:
        * need abstraction barriers that isolate different design choices from each other & permit different choices to co-exist in a program
     * large programs are often created by combining pre-existing modules designed in isolation
         * need conventions that permit programmers to incorporate modules into larger systems without having to redesign or reimplement them
         * "additive" - ?
* in this section:
    * learn how to cope with data that may be represented in different ways by different parts of the program
    * generic procedures
        * procedures that can operate on data that may be represented in more than one way
        * type tags:
            * explicit information attached to data objects about how the object is to be processed
        * data directed programming:
            * implementation strategy for additively assembling systems with generic operations
    * complex number example
        * will use type tags and data directed style to design an abstraction that supports both rectangular and polar representations
        * will accomplish this by:
            * defining arithmetic procedures for complex numbers in terms of generic selectors 
            * generic selectors access parts of a complex number independent of how the number is represented
        * two different kinds of abstraction barriers:
            * 'horizontal barrier'
                * previous chapters
                * isolate 'higher level' operations from 'lower level' representation
            * 'vertical barrier'
                * gives us ability to separately design and install alternative representations
* next section (2.5)
    * will show how to use type tags and data directed style to develop a generic arithmetic package
    * provides procedures that can be used to manipulate all sorts of 'numbers' and can be easily extended for new types of numbers
    * 2.5.3 will show how to extend this package to a system that performs symbolic algebra

### 2.4.1 Representations for Complex Numbers
* will develop a system the performs arithmetic operations on complex numbers
    * simple but unrealistic example of a program that uses generic operations
    * two plausible representations:
        * rectangular form (real + imaginary parts)
        * polar form (magnitude and angle)
    * section 2.4.2 will show how both can coexist in a single system
        * using type tags and generic operations
* complex numbers
    * naturally represented as ordered pairs
        * set of complex numbers can be thought of as a two dimensional space with 'real' and 'imaginary' axes
        * rectangular form
    * addition/subtraction work the same as addition & subtraction in coordinate plane 
        * x & y values are combined separately from each other
    * in multiplication/division it is more natural to use polar form
        * the product of two complex numbers is the vector obtained by multiplying the magnitudes and adding the angles of those vectors
        * for division divide/subtract
* two different representations for complex numbers
    * principle of data abstraction suggests all operations for manipulating them should be available regardless of which representation is used
        * often useful to be able to find the magnitude of a complex number that is specified by polar coordinates
* to design such a system:
    * assume all operations are implemented in terms of four selectors:
        * real-part, imag-part, magnitude, angle
    * & two constructors
        * make-from-real-imag - specified by rectangular form
        * make-from-mag-ang - specified by polar form
        * both should produce equivalent representations for constructions of equivalent complex numbers
    * using the constructors and selectors:
        * can implement arithmetic on complex numbers using 'abstract data' specified by the constructors and selectors
        * (in 2.4.scm)
    * to complete, must choose a representation and implement constructors and selectors in terms of primitive data structures (numbers and lists)
        * two obvious choices: rectangular or polar form
        * whichever is chosen, using the selector for the other form must perform a conversion

### 2.4.2 Tagged Data
* 'principle of least commitment'
    * abstraction barrier (selectors and constructors) permits us to defer choice of a concrete representation to the last possible moment
    * can also maintain ambiguity of representation even after designing selectors and constructors
        * can use *both* representations
        * will need a way to distinguish which underlying representation is being used
* type tag
    * a symbol included in a data structure to indicate to generic functions what format the data is in
* to manipulate tagged data:
    * selectors: `type-tag` and `contents`
    * constructor: `attach-tag`
* using these procedures, can define predicates to recognize representation used for a complex number
    * `'rectangular` and `'polar`
    * separate selectors and constructors for each representation
    * generic selectors that choose the appropriate selector for the representation based on the type tag
    * generic constructors construct data object based on which constructor is called
        * make-from-real-imag constructs a rectangular representation
        * make-from-mag-ang constructs a polar representation
* complex number system 
    * three relatively independent parts:
        * API
            * `add-complex`, `sub-complex`, `mul-complex`, `div-complex`
        * package
            * selectors and constructors
        * language primitives
            * lists, numbers, arithmetic
    * each data object is tagged with its type
        * selectors can operate on data in a generic manner
        * general mechanism:
            * within a given representation implementation, data is an untyped pair
            * when a generic selector operates on tagged data, it strips off the tag and passes the raw data to the correct implementation
        * stripping off and attaching of tags as data objects are passed from level to level can be an important organizational strategy

### 2.4.3 Data-Directed Programming and Additivity
* *dispatching on type* / *type dispatching*
    * general strategy of checking the type of a datum to choose the appropriate implementation of a procedure to call
    * powerful strategy for achieving modularity in system design
* previous example has two significant weaknesses:
    * generic interface procedures must know about all different representations
        * if a new representation was added, a new clause would have to be added to (hardcoded into) each generic interface procedure for it
    * even though individual representations can be designed separately, must guarantee that no two procedures in the system have name conflicts
* issue underlying these weaknesses: technique isn't additive
    * implementing generic selectors requires modifying the procedures each time a new representation is added
    * implementing the individual representations requires avoiding name conflicts
    * these requirements are straightforwards but are a source of inconvenience and error
    * not a huge issue in complex number system, but other systems may have:
        * hundreds of different representations
        * many different generic procedures to be maintained
    * no one programmer could know all the interface procedures or representations
    * problem is real and must be addressed in programs such as large-scale database management systems
* *data-directed programming*
    * system for modularizing design even further
    * can view dealing with a set of generic operations that apply to a set of types as a two dimensional table
        * axes are procedures and types
        * entries are implementations of a procedure for a type
    * in complex number example, correspondence between operation name, data type, and actual procedures were spread out among conditional clauses in the generic interface procedures
        * same information could have been organized into a table as described above
* *data-directed programming*
    * technique of designing programs to work with such a table directly
    * previous example implemented interface between complex number arithmetic and the two representations as a set of procedures that perform explicit dispatch on type
    * this example will implement the interface as a single procedure that looks up the combination of operation name and argument type in a table
        * returns a procedure and applies it to the data
        * adding new representations or procedures means only adding new entries to the table
* to implement: 
    * two procedures for manipulating the operation-and-type table
        * `(put op type item)`
            * adds `item` to table, indexed by `op` and `type`
        * `(get op type)`
            * gets `item` from table, indexed by `op` and `type`
            * if nothing present at that index, return `false`
        * (currently an assumption that these functions are implemented)
    * procedures are made to define and `put` the implementation functions for each data type
        * since functions are defined locally to these procedures, their names can't cause conflicts
    * complex arithmetic procedures access the table by means of a general procedure which applies a generic operation to some arguments
        * `(apply-generic op . args)`
            * accesses the type tags of the args and looks up the operation/type signature combo  
            * uses `apply` internally to apply the procedure found by `get` to the contents of `args`
    * can define generic procedures by calling `apply-generic` with the key of the function to be used
        * these aren't affected by adding new procedures or representations (stable interface, low maintenance code)
        * can also define constructors that don't need to be generic
            * simple `get` the matching representation's constructor when constructing from real and imaginary parts  or from magnitude and angle

Exercise 2.73
1. 
    * The `cond` blocks for each operation type were removed from `deriv` and moved to a two dimensional map of procedures and types. Currently the only procedure in the map is `'deriv` so it is effectively one-dimensional but able to be extended by adding new procedures to the first dimension of the map.
    * `number?` and `variable?` aren't included in the dispatch because they are primitive data types and don't require tagging. The question phrases this as "why *can't*" they be included though, which is confusing since IDK you couldn't just add a type tag to them?
    * e.g. instead of being `1` or `'x` they would be `('num 1)` and `('var 'x)` and the types 'num and 'var could be included in the map of types and operations
4. All of the `put` and `get` expressions would need to have their arguments reversed

Exercise 2.74
1. The division's records can be structured any way that makes sense to them but an installer function must be created that aliases a map of `'employee-records <division-name>` to a getter function for their internal representation
2. Same as above but for the individual employee records and the internal getter for this data must be aliased into a map of `'salary <divison-name>`
4. New personnel data must have an installer defined which maps the getters for the new division's internal representation of data to the `get` map

##### Message passing
* key idea of data-directed programming:
    * handle generic operations by dealing explicitly with operation-x-type tables
* implementations of this:
    * examples in 2.4.2 organized type dispatch by having each operation take care of its own dispatching
        * 'intelligent operations'
        * decomposes operation-x-type table into rows
    * examples in 2.4.3 use an explicit table data object that owns dispatching for both operations and types
    * another strategy:
        * decompose operation-x-type table into columns
        * by using 'intelligent data objects' to perform type dispatch based on operation names passed in to them
* intelligent data objects
    * can be created by representing a data object as a function 
        * parameters: operation name
        * returns a procedure that applies the matching operation for that data object
* this style of programming is called *message passing*
    * name comes from the metaphor that a data object is an entity that receives a message about what it should do

Exercise 2.76
* changes that must be made to extend system:
    * generic operations with explicit dispatch
        * types: each operation must have that type added to its cond block
        * operations: a new operation must be written that includes cases for existing types
    * data-directed style (operation-and-type table)
        * types: types must be added to the table for each operation
        * operations: operations their implementations for each type must be added to the table
    * message-passing style
        * types: a new data type is defined with dispatch for existing operations
        * operations: new operations must be added to each type 
* most appropriate for a system in which types must often be added:
    * message-passing
    * types can be implemented one at a time, with operations implemented for them all in one place
* most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added:
    * generic operations with explicit dispatch
    * operations can be implemented one at a time, with type dispatch implemented for them all in one place
* data-directed programming is useful in either case or when both types and operations are expected to be added regularly
