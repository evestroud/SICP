### 1.3.2
* (my note) reinforces my understanding of `let` vs `let*`
	* `let` is a macro for `((lambda (params) (body)) args)`
		* this is why definitions don't cascade -- all values are evaluated before being mapped to an environment
		* useful if you want to shadow a variable but have multiple definitions 
	* doesn't yet cover `let*` - is this a macro or builtin?

* Exercise 1.34

`(define (f g) (g 2))
`(f f)
`-> (f (f 2)) -> (2 2) => Wrong type to apply: 2

### 1.3.3 Procedures as General Methods
* procedures used to express general methods of computation
	* independent of particular functions involved
	* this section - more elaborate examples

##### finding roots of equations by the half-interval method
* half-interval method
	* finding roots of an equation (`f(x) = 0)` 
		* where `f` is a continuous function
	* inputs: `a` and `b`
		* where `f(a) < 0 < f(b)
	* procedure:
		* set x to be the average of a and b
		* if f(x) < 0, repeat with x, b
		* if f(x) > 0 repeat with a, x
		* if f(x) is close enough to 0, return x as result
			* according to an arbitrary interval of precision
	* time complexity
		* interval of uncertainty is halved at each step
			* O(log L / T)
				* where L is the length of the initial interval
				* and T is the error tolerance

##### Finding fixed points of functions
* fixed point of a function
	* number `x` where `f(x) = x
	* for some functions, can locate by beginning with a guess and repeatedly applying f until `f(f(...f(x)...)) = x

Exercise 1.36
* averaging the guess and next values when making the next recursive calls in this case reduces the number of calls required by more than 3 times

Exercise 1.37
* k >= 12 produces an approximation accurate to four decimal places

### 1.3.4 Procedures as Returned Values
* can achieve more expressive power by creating procedures whose returned values are themselves procedures
* programmers should be alert for opportunities to identify underlying abstractions in our programs
	* build upon & generalize them to create more powerful abstractions
	* avoid always writing everything as abstractly as possible though
		* choose level of abstraction appropriate to the task
* significance of higher order procedures
	* enable representing abstractions explicitly as elements in our code
* programming languages impose restrictions on how different computational elements can be manipulated
	* elements with fewest restrictions are "first class"
		* may be given names as variables
		* may be passed into and returned by procedures
		* may be included in data structures
	* lisp (and now many other popular languages) gives procedures first class 'status'
