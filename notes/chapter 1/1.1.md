### 1.1.5 - The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
* substitution model
	* was confused when composing programs described this as inadequate
	* sicp specifies that "substitution model" as literally replacing the text in the written examples
		* also that the inadequecy involves how names are resolved wrt scope
* applicative order vs normal order evaluation
	* similar to "big step" vs "small step" evaluation in FICS ch 10?
		* i feel like this is different but I didn't quite grasp the big step/ small step thing
	* applicative order
		* evaluate each element in a function's arguments, then call fn with simplified values
		* actually used by Scheme
	* normal order
		* fully expand the implications of an expression then solve
		* e.g. (square (+ 1 1)) would expand to (* (+ 1 1) (+ 1 1))
		* for procedures that can be modeled with simple substitution, produces the same result as applicative
		* less efficient (results in repeated calculations)
		* can still be a valuable tool (?), book will investigate this in chapters 3 & 4
			* ch3 - stream processing involves normal order evaluation apparently
			* ch4 - interpreter mode with normal order evaluation

### 1.1.6 - Conditional Expressions and Predicates
* if vs cond
	* if will only evaluate a single expression at a time
		* since consequent and alternative are positional
	* cond can evaluate multiple expressions
		* since the predicate and consequent are bundled

exercises
* 1.2
```
(/  (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5)))))
	(* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
```

* 1.3
```
(define (sum-of-squares-of-largest x y z)
	(cond
		[(and (x <= y) (x <= z)) (sum-of-squares yz)]
		[(and (y <= x) (y <= z)) (sum-of-squares xz)]
		[(and (z <= x) (z <= y)) (sum-of-squares xy)]))
```

* 1.4
the body of the function uses an if expression to determine which operator to apply based on a predicate

* 1.5
applicative order - the interpreter will get stuck in a recursive loop
normal order - the expression will evaluate to 0 and (p) will never be evaluated

* 1.6
because new-if is a standard function, its arguments are evaluated at call time, unlike the special forms if and cond which prevent clauses from being evaluated until after the predicate is. This means that sqrt-iter will produce infinite recursive calls as its then and else clauses are evaluated together before calling new-if.

* 1.7
This implementation of `good-enough?` won't work well for very small numbers because it uses a fixed precision that may be as large or larger than the input. This could lead to a very early, rough guess being returned as the solution.
* example: `(sqrt .000001)` outputs 0.03~, when the correct answer is .001

It also won't work for very large numbers because the maximum precision of a float may be larger than the precision of `good-enough?`, which would result in an infinite loop as the precision would never be good enough.
* example: `(sqrt 1000000000000000)` does not terminate

alternative solution: see `~/guile/SICP/chapter-1/1-1.scm
* this produces the correct result in both of the above examples
